This is a flat HTML blog site. It uses no database and loads quickly. The site is assembled with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) after being written in HTML, [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org), and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for the CSS and the base styles are from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework. [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is used for scaleable vector icons, and [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) is used in conjuction with [Wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/) to provide animated elements. The site's .htaccess utilizes [static asset caching](http://gtmetrix.com/leverage-browser-caching.html) to further improve performance.

The site is a work in progress and currently has had no compression or minification done on code or images.
